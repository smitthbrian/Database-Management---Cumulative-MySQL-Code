Project title: Database Schema Design and Implementation

Course: CIS3840: Database Management using SQL 

This assignment focuses on designing and implementing a relational database using MySQL. The goal is to create a schema that showcases normalization principles, ensuring that our data remains clean and efficient.

In this project, I’ve created tables for various entities like customers, employees, invoices, and items. Each table has been carefully structured to represent its data accurately while establishing relationships through foreign keys.

The tables include:

 - Customer: Where all the customer details live, along with their assigned sales representatives.

 - Employees: Split into two versions for 2NF and 3NF to highlight different normalization stages.

 - Invoices and Items: To manage sales and products effectively.

 - Projects and Assignments: To keep track of project details and who’s working on what.

I used MySQL to put it all together, and it was a great way to get hands-on experience with database design. 
This project has helped me dive deeper into how relational databases work and the importance of keeping data organized—skills that are super useful in the world of information systems.
