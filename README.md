# Database-Management---Cumulative-MySQL-Code
This MySQL code creates a series of interrelated tables for a database management system, using normalization through different normal forms (2NF and 3NF) while defining relationships between entities like customers, employees, projects, and assignments. This was part of my coursework in CIS3840, Database Management at Walker College of Business.
